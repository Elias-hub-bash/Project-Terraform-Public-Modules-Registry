Terraform Modules - Public Module Registry

Hashicorp maintains a public registry that helps you to consume Terraform modules from others. 
The Terraform Public Registry is an index of modules shared publicly and is the easiest way to get started with Terraform and find modules created by others in the community. 
It includes support for module versioning and searchable and filterable list of available modules for quickly deploying common infrastructure configurations.

Modules on the public Terraform Registry can be sourced using a registry source address of the form <NAMESPACE>/<NAME>/<PROVIDER>, 
with each module's information page on the registry site including the exact address to use.
